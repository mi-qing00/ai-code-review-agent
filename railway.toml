# Note: For multiple services, configure per-service in Railway dashboard:
# - Start Command: Use "bash scripts/railway_start.sh" with SERVICE_TYPE env var
# - Restart Policy: Configure per service (web: ON_FAILURE, worker: ALWAYS)
# - These settings are now configured per-service in Railway dashboard, not globally

# [deploy] section removed - configure per-service in Railway dashboard:
# - Web service: Restart Policy = "ON_FAILURE" (default)
# - Worker service: Restart Policy = "ALWAYS" (required for continuous processing)
